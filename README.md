# Road Reaper
A game in which you play as a grim reaper harvesting the souls of unlucky pedestrians who fail to safely cross the road, while also avoiding the cars. Be quick and catch them before they ascend. Also keep an eye on the clock!

The game can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/quotepilgrim/road-reaper/releases) page.

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move.
